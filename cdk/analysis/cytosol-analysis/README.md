# Cytosol Analysis

Tools for working with data from bulk cytosol assays, particularly those performed on plate readers.

## Cytosol Kinetics
Analyzes kinetics of expression as read by a plate reader, and outputs data and plots describing key kinetic parameters of each reaction including lag time, maximum velocity, and the steady-state maximum expression level.
